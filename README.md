An analysis of Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

This project analyses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, where breast tissue cytological features were digitally scanned and analysed. Ten features from each one of the cells in the sample. Then, the mean, standard error (SE) and largest 'worst' (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.
